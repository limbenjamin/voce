voce theme for Pelican
======================

[voce](https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce) is a responsive theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). It was templated on [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/gfidente/pelican-svbhack) by [Giulio Fidente](https://github.com/giulivo). It is lightweight and suitable for text heavy articles.


## Demo

You can see the theme in action on [my site](https://limbenjamin.com/)

## Features

- Clean, responsive design. Scales to fit any screen
- Fully usable without Javascript (although enabling it adds more functionality)
- Ability to hide email addresses from spambots
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Integrated Google Analytics
- Custom sidebar links and social icons
- Fuzzy date display (ex: "Posted 2 days ago") using Javascript
- Automatically minifies and compresses Javascript and CSS

## Dependencies

For automatic minification and compression of assets, this theme uses the
[webassets](https://webassets.readthedocs.org/) package, along with `cssmin` for
minifying css, `slimit` for compressing Javascript, and `libsass` for
compiling the [SCSS](http://www.sass-lang.com) styles.

- All these can be installed with `pip` by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Additionally, to integrate the `webassets` package into pelican, the [pelican-assets plugin](https://github.com/pR0Ps/pelican-assets)
is required. It's included in this repo as a submodule so it just needs to be
activated in `pelicanconf.py`.

- Add `"<theme dir>/plugins"` to the `PLUGIN_PATHS` list (or `os.path.join("<theme dir>", "plugins")` if you're feeling Pythonic)
- Add `"assets"` to the `PLUGINS` list

## Installing

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/limbenjamin/voce) making sure to get the submodules (ex: `git clone --recursive <repo>`)
2. Install and configure the required dependencies (see above)
3. Modify the `THEME` variable in `pelicanconf.py` to point to the cloned theme location
4. Customize the theme using the options below

## pelicanconf.py

When developing locally, you may want to set `SITEURL` to something like `http://localhost:8000`

This theme supports a number of custom variables:

- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`: Your Google Analytics UA-XXXXXXXX-X code (`None` to disable analytics).
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PROP`: Your Google Analytics property name (`None` to disable analytics).
- `USER_LOGO_URL`: The image to display in the center of the page. Can be local or a remote URL.
- `MANGLE_EMAILS`: If enabled, any emails in the `SOCIAL` or `LINKS` lists will be obfuscated in HTML and have their links generated by Javascript when the page loads.
- `GLOBAL_KEYWORDS`: A list of strings that will be set as meta keywords for each page.
- `FUZZY_DATES`: If `True`, uses [lw-timeago](https://github.com/pR0Ps/lw-timeago) to display fuzzy dates on articles (eg. 'Posted 3 months ago').
